# FEST-RS

Rewrite of [FEST](https://github.com/RainThunder/FEST) in Rust.

## Motivation

Simple: Like a Windows user, I just wanted to download an executable, point it to a file, and get an output.

But of course, it's not that simple on Linux since it is an `exe`, and messing with WINE was a no-go for me, so I thought about rewriting the project in a way that can result in a simple executable for Linux too.

As for why I chose Rust, I just thought it was a good way to learn about the language outside of the tutorials, and given the "hype" of rewriting everything in Rust, I said "why not?", and here it is.
